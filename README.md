Week 1

This week, my group and I came up with a rough idea to tackle the problem statement assigned to us, “How can we make OCBC’s online banking more accessible to people with impaired mobility”. We thought of a voice command feature that would convert the user’s words from speech to text, the text will then be processed by a classification model, matching the command to a specific function. 

Besides coming up with a rough idea on what we will be working on, we have also allocated roles to all group members. Xin Yin and Xue Wen will be taking charge of the front-end development while Bi De, myself (Ervin) and Keene will be in charge of back-end development.

During our discussion on Thursday (19/10/2023) discussion, we were still not too comfortable with one another and it would take us time to voice out our opinions. Although this led to us spending much more time than we should have, I’m not too worried as the group will warm up to one another after subsequent interactions.



Week 2 

This week, my group had a meeting with a representitive from OCBC to disucss some of the features we had come up with the previous week.
After receiving some feedback from the representitive, we decided to focus our efforts on implementing our solutions into OCBC's web application.
We also decided to put more focus on developing the keybind and gesture/eye tracking features.

I felt that the discussion we had this week was extremely productive, with it providing us a more focused view on how to move forward with development


Week 3

This week, my group consulted the Coach at OCBC regarding the progress of our work the past 2 weeks. Based on the previous weeks' work, we suggested that we place greater focus on developiung the 
voice command and keybind features due to the limitations in the capabilities of the previously proposed eye-tracker controlled cursor. Throughout the course of this week, we have begun development of our solution and created a Trello board to keep track
of tasks that are to be/ have been done in order to ensure transparency among the group.

Overall, I feel that this week has been very productive as approach the Hackathon in week 5.
